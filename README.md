This is my very first project that I created in the 2022 Girls Who Code Summer Immersion program! In this website, you will find a multitude of facts to equip you with the knowledge you need to explore this topic. Since building this, I have had the motivation to learn more about the digital divide and get involved. Now, I try to bridge that gap by targeting underrepresented groups, such as formerly incarcerated students and girls, to chase their passions for tech.

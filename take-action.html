		<p>
			A main focus we must take toward bridging the gap is expanding the knowledge and skillset of those currently struggling through accessible workshops that teach digital skills, free to use resources like computers, etc. As Francine Katsoudas through
			<a href="https://theoceancleanup.com"> We Forum</a> describes, "Digital skills training is the key that unlocks the potential connectivity holds." Enlisting in those who are fortunate enough to teach others allows us to spread technical knowledge, which is critical for many job sectors in this day and age.

    <!-- Section of more facts on the digital divide -->
		<p>
      Francine states, "Digital access and skills — for all — are fundamental to participating in our societies and economies. " <p>

        <p>
			Your action today can be to call your congress person demanding more opportunties for access be worked toward. This change may include creating organizations that teach digital skills in underprivileged communities, fundraising for more access to free computers in community spaces such as libraries, and more initiatives that you may come up with!</a>

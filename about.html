          Hi. My name is Amel and I created this project during the Summer Immersion Program at Girls Who Code. I was motivated to make this website because after learning about the Digital Divide and the biases that are further perpetuated by it, this has been an issue I am passionate about and would like to dedicate projects toward in the future. I hope you learn something from this website!

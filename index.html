          Plastic is obviously useful, however it is tremendously harmful. Single-use plastic products have severe environmental and economic consequences. Despite recycling efforts, a whopping 75 to 199 million tons of plastic can be found in our planet's oceans, causing extreme harm to marine life and the globe as a whole.
